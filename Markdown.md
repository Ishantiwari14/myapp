# Structuring Documents
 We can add different levels of headings to structure our documents. `#` for a  header, `##` adding hashes makes smaller heading sizes.You can write upto `######` six heading sizes.
###Bolds or Italics
`*word* or _word_` _for_ *Italics*


`**word** or __word__` __for__ **Bold**

_**Combining** them __works__ too_

~~word~~ for strikethrough


### Links to Websites or Images
`[Link Name!](http://site.com)`
for links like [Google!](http://google.com)
`![Image Name](http://Imagelink)`
for images like ![apple](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHistory_of_Apple_Inc.&psig=AOvVaw1dEtdrqGR9HOC87FQPyKZD&ust=1591598976118000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCKCH-rGO7-kCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

### Lists
 For Numbered lists:
 1. Write numbers,One
 2. Two
 3. Three

For Bullet points:
* Start with a star
* Works doesn't it.

Alternatively,
- Dashes work too
- Just like that.
  - Two spaces before dash or star, for sublists.

For Ordered lists,
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
  1. Item 2a
  1. Item 2b

### Writing Codes
For Inline Codes, wrap them in backticks: `int size = 10`

For longer blocks of codes, indent with four spaces:

    if (understand){
    	return true
    }

We can also write without identation, for that use three bacticks ```

```
for (i = 0;i < 10 ; i++)
{
	printf("%d",&i);
}
```

for Syntax highlightint we can include the language:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
{
	/* code */
}

```

### Extras
 For directing a comment at someone, prefix the name with`@` symbol.

 Tasks lists can work too:
 - [x] This is completed.
 - [ ] This isn't.

### Tables 
 We can create tables too, by assembing a list of words and dividing the first row with hyphens `-` , and separating each column with pipe `|`.

```
 First Header | Second Header
 ------------ | --------------
 from cell 1 | from cell 2
 from first column | from second column
```
